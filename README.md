# BBimageOverlay
Makes an image overlay to show Bowling Bash lines on top of the minimap

Start the program align the "+-" with the "+-" of your Ragnarok Online window.
To change the map right click the title bar. A new window will open to insert the new map name. 

Note:
  -Map names need to be as shown when typing "/where" e.g prt_fild05 
  -This program in no way attaches/hooks itself to the Ragnarok binary files nor modifies any Ragnarok related files!! It is a standalone program that just is drawn always on top (of any program)
  -Depending on the map your location may not be 100% displayed correctly. So treat this program more like a guideline.
